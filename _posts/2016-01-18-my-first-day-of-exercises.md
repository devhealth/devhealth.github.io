Yes, it sucks. You are trying to get out of a sedentary life. You go to a gym and starts the running on a 5.0 velocity in the treadmill and look to the side. A woman running in a 10.0 velocity and other guy on 12.0. I was feeling like a vegetable...

## My first impressions

I do not make exercises a long time and at 5 minutes, my legs and my calf it was exploding and screaming to me to stop everthing.

But ok, it's my first day. I will not give up! No problem if the people on my side are running at 20 and 6 miles. It will be slow but progressive.

## Lessons learned

Before start to run, it's healthy make some stretching exercises. Another thing is start slowly and increase velocity step by step.

One last tip is ignore the other people around. Focus on your step and listen some music or a podcast (like devnaestrada.com.br =D).
