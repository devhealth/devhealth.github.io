I started very slow, this is my first week that I want to make the right things. I got in a new lifestyle.

## My new lifestyle

I wake up at 5:00 AM to take a bus and go to SÃ£o Paulo, I'm from Indaiatuba that is 100km far away to the big city.
I'm trying to eat much better than before, but It's hard yet.

## Today, my day

When I came back after work, I walked to my home around 30 minutes.
I felt pain in my legs, hard breath, yes ... true sad.

This is my weight today:
